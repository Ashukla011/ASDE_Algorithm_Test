#### Time complexity 

 The main loop runs 11 times, once for each circle
  Each condition involves constant time operations , 
 Handling the special cases for enemies at circle 3 and 7 also involves constant time operations, as the are just simple arithmetic and conditional checks;
 since all operations inside the loops are constant time operation 
 and the loop runs a fixed numner of time the time complexity is 
 #### O(1)

###### if we generalize the problem to have n circles instead of a fixed number of circles, the time complxity world be O(n) where n is the number of circles
